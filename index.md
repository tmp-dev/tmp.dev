## About

The is an project team page. Be sure to check it out from time to time as we work in project related to Gaming, Development and other topics!

## The vision

We are a group of driven people, who all want to create something we can enjoy ourself, or help other with. Think about a chat bot that helps you manage multi channel communities (Discord, Forum and servers). 

## Projects and idea's

We have many idea's to what to develop next! But most of us have day time jobs. So most work is done during the evenings or weekends.
